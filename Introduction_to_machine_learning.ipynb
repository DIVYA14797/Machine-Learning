        "1. Clustering: Unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering can group data points into clusters based on their similarity. Anomalies are then identified as data points that don't belong to any cluster or are significantly different from the rest of the data within a cluster.\n",

Data points with low probability densities are considered anomalies since they occur in regions of the feature space where the data is unlikely to be found.\n",

High reconstruction errors indicate anomalous instances.\n",

It works by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of that feature. This process is repeated recursively to isolate anomalies which require fewer splits to separate from the rest of the data.\n",

        "6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used as a preprocessing step for anomaly detection. By projecting data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, PCA preserves the most important information in the data while removing noise. Anomalies can then be identified as data points with large reconstruction errors when projected back to the original high-dimensional space.\n",
