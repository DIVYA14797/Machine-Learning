If you're concerned about the curse of dimensionality and want to save memory, binary encoding might be preferable. However, if you're using algorithms like decision trees or random forests that handle categorical variables naturally, you can stick with one-hot encoding.\n",

This preserves the ordinal nature of the variable, which might be useful for certain algorithms. Alternatively, if your algorithm doesn't assume any ordinal relationship between categories, you can use one-hot encoding.\n",
